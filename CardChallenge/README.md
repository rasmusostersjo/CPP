CardChallenge:
==============
A simple memory game where the player gets to look at each card, as long as
desired, once. Then the user is asked to restate every card in the correct
order.

Note:
=====
Cards are restated on the format "color" "value". (!)<br/>

Hearts: h <br/>
Clubs: c <br/>
Dimoands: d <br/>
Spades: s <br/><br/>

Ace: a <br/>
Two: 2 <br/>
Three: 3 <br/>
Four: 4 <br/>
Five: 5 <br/>
Six: 6 <br/>
Seven: 7 <br/>
Eight: 8 <br/>
Nine: 9 <br/>
Ten: 1 (!!) <br/>
Jack: j <br/>
Queen: q <br/>
King: k <br/>

<br/><br/>
(!): (Hearts, Jack) would be restated as: h j <br/>
(!!): Since Ace is restated by 'a', it is fine to restate a 10 with just the '1'.
